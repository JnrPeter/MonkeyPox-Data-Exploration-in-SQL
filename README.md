## Overview of Project
The monkeypox virus causes monkeypox, an uncommon condition that resembles smallpox. Although it has been spotted in other parts of the world, it is primarily prevalent

- What is the number confirmed cases in each country?
- What is the number of suspected cases in each country?

- What is the most common symptom of monkey pox amongst people who have been confirmed with disease worldwide?
- What are the most common symptoms of monkey pox amongst people who have been suspected with disease worldwide?
- In what month have most cases been confirmed? 
- What is the average time delay between onset of monkey pox disease and confirmation of disease?
- What are the number of people in each country that have been hospitalized?
