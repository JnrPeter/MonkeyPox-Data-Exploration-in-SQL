## Overview of Project
The monkeypox virus causes monkeypox, an uncommon condition that resembles smallpox. Although it has been spotted in other parts of the world, it is primarily prevalent 
in parts of Africa. In this Project I perfromed an SQL Data Exploratory Analysis of the monkey pox outbreak with a dataset obtained from Kaggle [here][1].

### SQL Queries were used to gain insights from the dataset using the questions below

- What are total number of confirmed,suspected and discarded cases worldwide?
- What are the number confirmed cases in each country?
- What are the number of suspected cases in each country?
- What are the number of Discarded cases in each country?
- What are the means confirmation of disease for countries with confirmed cases?
- Find the number of times a method was used to confirm a diseases in each country.
- What age ranges have been mostly confirmed with the disease?
- What age range have been most suspected to have the disease?
- What common symptoms did people confirmed with the disease present with in each country?
- How many cases are confirmed daily?
- What are the common symptoms of monkey pox amongst people who have been confirmed with disease worldwide?
- What are the common symptoms of monkey pox amongst people who have been suspected with disease worldwide?
- In what month have most cases been confirmed? 
- What is the average time delay between onset of monkey pox disease and confirmation of disease?
- What are the number of people in each country that have been hospitalized?
- Find the number of people in each country who have been suspected or confirmed with the disease who have been hospitalized
- Find the number of people who have been suspected or confirmed with the disease who have been isolated in each country
- What are the number of confirmed or suspected cases in each country who have a travel history ?
