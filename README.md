# Exploratory Analysis of Monkey Pox in MySQL

## Description of Project Files
- Monkey Pox Data Exploration in MySQL : An SQL file containing all the SQL queries for the Project
- README.md : A file containing an overview, summary and description of the entire Project.
- isolation_records.csv : The Monkeypox csv dataset,containing hospitalization and isolation records
- patient_records.csv : The Monkeypox csv dataset,containing patient information


## Overview of Project
The monkeypox virus causes monkeypox, an uncommon condition that resembles smallpox. Although it has been spotted in other parts of the world, it is primarily prevalent 
in parts of Africa. In this Project I perfromed an SQL Data Exploratory Analysis of the monkey pox outbreak with a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

### SQL Queries were used to gain insights from the dataset using the questions below

- What are total number of confirmed,suspected and discarded cases worldwide?
- What are the number confirmed cases in each country?
- What are the number of suspected cases in each country?
- What are the number of Discarded cases in each country?
- What are the means confirmation of disease for countries with confirmed cases?
- Find the number of times a method was used to confirm a diseases in each country.
- What age ranges have been mostly confirmed with the disease?
- What age range have been most suspected to have the disease?
- What common symptoms did people confirmed with the disease present with in each country?
- How many cases are confirmed daily?
- What are the common symptoms of monkey pox amongst people who have been confirmed with disease worldwide?
- What are the common symptoms of monkey pox amongst people who have been suspected with disease worldwide?
- In what month have most cases been confirmed? 
- What is the average time delay between onset of monkey pox disease and confirmation of disease?
- What are the number of people in each country that have been hospitalized?
- Find the number of people in each country who have been suspected or confirmed with the disease who have been hospitalized
- Find the number of people who have been suspected or confirmed with the disease who have been isolated in each country
- What are the number of confirmed or suspected cases in each country who have a travel history ?

## INSIGHTS
The number of total cases is 1,132, with 920 of them being confirmed cases ,67 and 145 being suspected and discarded cases respectively. England and Spain have the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases respectively. The Reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method used for testing or confirming monkey pox across the infected countries. The analysis revealed that, the number of infected people between the ages of 20 to 64 are much higher than other age ranges. About 30 people worldwide suffered genital ulcer lesions as a common symptom but a significant number (826) of people suffered symptoms that are unknown. It was discovered that for a case of monkey pox the average time delay between onset of disease and confirmation is a period of about 12 days. The total number of people hospitalized and isolated, who have been suspected or confirmed are 62 and 127 respectively. The number of people who have suspected or confirmed of the disease with travel history are higher in the United States than the other countries.
